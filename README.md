# react-test-jasmine-babel-rewire

When it comes to unit testing there is high possibility that you would like to mock some dependencies.

**babel-plugin-rewire**
It's a Babel plugin and has nothing to do with webpack inspired by rewire.js. The only working version for now is `1.0.0-beta-5`. I'd say it's quite good but rather unstable right now.
